### üí∞ Motivation

### üèó Implementation

- Give the `App` component an initial state for `grades` that is an empty `Array`.
- Define a `Header` Component that shows the title "Student Grade Table" and include it in `App`'s `render` method.
- [After the `App` component has mounted](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount), send a `GET` request to retrieve all of the JSON grades on the server and update `App`'s state. You can check the state of the `App` component in many ways, including:
  - [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
  - Console log in [`componentDidUpdate()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate)
  - Console log in the callback for [`setState()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate)
- Define a `Grade` component that takes a single `grade` via props and renders a [Bootstrap-styled](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/tables/) table row.
- Define a `GradeTable` component that takes all of the `grades` of via props and renders a [Bootstrap-styled](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/tables/) table.
- Modify `App`'s `render` method to include `GradeTable`, passing its `grades` state as a prop.
